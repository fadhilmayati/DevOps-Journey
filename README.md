My DevOps Journey

This is a repository where I'm documenting my journey on learning DevOps. My goal is to share my experience, knowledge and challenges, and also to keep track of my progress and accomplishments.

Why DevOps?

I've always been interested in technology, and as I started to learn more about software development, I realized that DevOps is a key aspect of building and delivering software products. DevOps combines different practices and tools to automate and streamline the software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment and monitoring. I find DevOps fascinating because it allows teams to work collaboratively and efficiently, and to deliver value to customers faster and more reliably.

What I'm Learning

In this repository, I'll be documenting the topics, tools and techniques that I'm learning on my DevOps journey. Some of the areas that I'm focusing on include:
        -Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
        -Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
        -Containerization and Orchestration
        -Cloud Computing and Serverless Architecture
        -Monitoring and Logging

I'm also experimenting with different tools and technologies, such as:
        -Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
        -Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation for IaC
        -Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS for containerization
        -AWS, GCP, Azure for cloud computing
        -ELK Stack, Grafana for monitoring and logging

How I'm Learning

There are many resources available for learning DevOps, including books, online courses, tutorials, and communities. Some of the resources that I've found helpful so far are:
        The DevOps Handbook
        Google Cloud Training
        Kubernetes Documentation
        DevOps Stack Exchange
I'm also trying to apply what I learn to real-world projects and challenges, and to collaborate with others who share my interest in DevOps.

What's Next

My DevOps journey is a continuous process of learning and improving. Some of the goals that I have for the future include:
        Contributing to open-source DevOps projects
        Obtaining professional certifications in DevOps and cloud computing
        Building a personal DevOps lab environment to experiment and practice
        Sharing my knowledge and experience with others through blog posts, talks, and mentoring
